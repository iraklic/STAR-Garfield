0. In order the program to compile and run you need a correct setup. To get the right setup you need to source setup.sh
	source setup.sh

1. To quickly run the code ONLY to plot the geometry:
	root -q -b lGarfield.C 'tpcGL.C+(0, "geoTest.root", "<your_geometry>")'
	This will make two gif files. One for geometry another for the field.

2. To run the jobs:
	make sure you put right geometry in tpcGL.xml
	star-submit tpcGL.xml

3. There is also a DrawFlux() function defined in the code. You can run it on the files that you get after simulation to make ion leak histograms
	a. Each job will give you one root file
	b. I usually combine root files : hadd final.root *.root
	c. root -l final.root
	d. .x lGarfield.C
	e. .L tpcGL.C+
	f. DrawFlux()
