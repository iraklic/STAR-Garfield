0. In order the program to compile and run you need a correct setup. To get the right setup you need to source setup.sh
	source setup.sh

1. To quickly run the code ONLY to plot the geometry:
	root -q -b lGarfield.C 'tpcGL.C+(0, "geoTest.root", "<your_geometry>")'
	This will make two gif files. One for geometry another for the field.

2. To run code interactively:
	root -q -b lGarfield.C 'tpcGL.C+(50, "testOutputFile.root", "TPC")'
	the above example will put 50 electrons and run the TPC geometry.

3. To run the jobs:
	make sure you put right geometry in tpcGL.xml
	Here are some available geometries:
	a. TPC <- regular TPC Geometry - Inner-Outer Region
	b. TPC_II <- if you add II it will choose Inner-Inner region
	c. TPC_OO <- if you add OO it will choose Outer-Outer region
	d. The geometries can be combined, e.g. adding II (OO) at the end of user defined geometry will concentrate on II (OO) region of this geometry.
	
	To submit the jobs:
	star-submit tpcGL.xml

	Make sure the submission line in the xml file contains the right geometry

4. There is also a DrawFlux() function defined in the code. You can run it on the files that you get after simulation to make ion leak histograms
	a. Each job will give you one root file
	b. It is usually a good idea to combine root files : hadd final.root *.root
	c. root -l final.root
	d. .x lGarfield.C
	e. .L tpcGL.C+
	f. DrawFlux()
